- added timestamp section to yaml file to specify exif fields for
  regular jpg and png/mov files.
- updated code to use timestamp fields specified in yaml file to

  (instead of utc time that requires offset), and png files have their
  original timestamp even though the file modification time could be
  changed by iphone for some strange reason.
